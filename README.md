In order for this app to work you need your own api key once you get it from openWeather (https://openweathermap.org/api) follow steps below

step 1 : In lib directory create a new directory named 'config' and inside this new directory create dart file named 'api_key'
step 2 : copy paste this code        class APIKEY {
                                          final apiKey = 'paste your api key here from open weahter api';
                                      }

step 3: paste your api key and app is ready 

let me know if you need an api key to test.
